export const acceptTermsText = `World Affiliates Program Terms — Outline (v0.1)

Date: October 31, 2025
 
0) Purpose & Relationship to Existing Terms
These Program Terms govern incentives for entities (“Affiliates”) who refer new users to verify with World. They incorporate by reference World User Terms (v4.0) and Tools for Humanity (TFH) User Terms. In the event of a conflict, these Program Terms control for referral incentive mechanics.
·       Rewarding Party: World Assets Ltd. (WLD economics).
·       Program Operator: World Foundation (governance & enforcement).
·       App Operator: Tools for Humanity (World App UX; promotions framework).
1) Definitions
·       Affiliate: An entity (or sole proprietor) enrolled in the Program that has completed KYB or a materially equivalent KYC to WF/TFH’s satisfaction.
·       New User: A natural person who has never completed a World verification and does not control an account previously used to verify.
·       Qualified Referral (QR): A New User who (i) signs up via an Affiliate code or link, (ii) completes verification (Orb/NFC per product availability), (iii) passes fraud and abuse checks, and (iv) is located in an eligible jurisdiction.
·       Affiliate Reward: A USD-denominated amount, payable in WLD subject to these Terms.
·       Attribution Window: The period (e.g., 30 days) between first code binding/click and verification within which an Affiliate may earn a reward.
·       Restricted Territories / Persons: New York State and Brazil (and any other territories designated by WF/TFH), and sanctioned or otherwise ineligible persons.
2) Eligibility & Onboarding
·       KYB/KYC: Affiliate must complete KYB or a meaningful KYC and ongoing sanctions/PEP screening.
·       Marketing law compliance: Affiliate must comply with applicable advertising, consumer protection, and disclosure rules in its markets.
·       Suspension/Termination: WF/TFH may suspend, withhold rewards, or terminate for risk, non-compliance, or policy violation.
3) Reward Schedule, Caps & Budgeting
·       Rate Card: Up to US$3 per Qualified Referral (QR). Program may vary by geography or campaign.
·       Caps: WF may set per-Affiliate and global caps and adjust them at any time.
·       No Double-Dipping: A New User cannot stack an Affiliate referral code with a user-referral code.
·       Change Rights: TFH/WF may modify or cancel promotions consistent with the underlying User Terms.
4) Attribution & Non-Stacking
A New User may apply one referral code. If multiple codes are presented, the first code successfully bound to the account prior to verification controls; later codes are rejected. If an Affiliate code and a user-referral code are both present, the first-bound code controls. Attribution expires after the Attribution Window if verification is not completed.
Fraud Nullification: Any QR tied to device-farming, self-referrals, fabricated identities, pay-for-verification schemes, or geo-evasion (VPN/proxy) is void. WF/TFH may withhold, reverse, or claw back rewards associated with such activity.
5) Reward Currency, Conversion & Balances
USD-Denominated; WLD Paid. For each QR, the Affiliate earns a USD-denominated amount per the active rate card. Rewards accrue to the Affiliate’s account in USD terms. Upon a valid withdrawal request, the accrued USD amount is converted into WLD using a Reference Rate determined at the time of the withdrawal request, and the resulting WLD amount is transferred to the linked wallet.
·       Reference Rate: A WF-published rate or methodology (e.g., time-weighted WLD/USD across designated venues) applied at the time of withdrawal.
·       Volatility: The WLD amount delivered will vary with market conditions; USD figures are informational only and not guaranteed.
·       No Value Guarantee: World makes no representation regarding the value or future value of WLD.
6) Vesting / Holdbacks / Clawbacks
·       Holdback: Rewards are provisional for a review window (e.g., 14–30 days) after verification to allow fraud and abuse review.
·       Clawback: WF may reverse, offset, or freeze balances upon evidence of fraud, policy breach, jurisdictional ineligibility, or identity re-use.
7) Withdrawals & Wallet Linking
·       Wallet: Affiliate must link a supported, self-custody wallet to receive WLD payouts.
·       Thresholds: WF may set minimum withdrawal thresholds and scheduling for operational efficiency.
·       Fees: On-chain fees are borne by Affiliate unless explicitly subsidized.
·       Third-Party Rails: WF/TFH are not responsible for third-party network or exchange failures or delays.
8) Territories, Sanctions & Compliance
Restricted Territories: WLD via World App is not available in New York State and Brazil. Any traffic routed from restricted territories is ineligible. Affiliates must not encourage VPN or proxy circumvention to access the Program.
Sanctions: Affiliate represents that it is not owned or controlled by, and will not target, pay, or route rewards to, sanctioned persons. WF/TFH may conduct screening and suspend participation on risk signals.
9) Marketing Standards & Brand Use
·       Truthful Promotion: Claims must be accurate, not misleading, and compliant with local law. Include required disclosures (e.g., “paid promotion”).
·       No Investment Promises: No statements suggesting WLD is an investment or will appreciate in value.
·       Brand Use: Use of World’s marks requires adherence to the Trademark Use Policy and prior written approval for logo use; nominative text use permitted with required disclaimers.
·       Channels: No spam or deceptive UX. Do not pay individuals to spoof identities or otherwise circumvent verification integrity.
10) Data & Privacy
Affiliates must not collect or store personal data from prospective users beyond what is necessary for lawful attribution and must comply with applicable data protection laws. In-app data processing is governed by TFH’s privacy notice; off-app processing is the Affiliate’s independent obligation.
11) Taxes & Fees
Affiliates are responsible for all taxes arising from rewards. WF/TFH may issue informational tax reports where required by law and may withhold to the extent required.
12) WF Authority & Discretion
·       WF may modify or cancel referral rewards at any time.
·       WF may modify eligibility or qualification criteria at its sole discretion.
13) Token Grant Terms Applicability
Payments are subject to, and conditioned upon compliance with, the WLD Token Grant Terms and Conditions, available at: https://world.org/token-grant-terms. By requesting withdrawal or accepting WLD rewards, Affiliate acknowledges and agrees to be bound by those terms.
14) Disclaimers & Risk
Tokens are experimental and volatile. Features and availability may change, and WF/TFH disclaim warranties to the maximum extent permitted by law. Nothing in these Terms constitutes investment advice.
15) IP; No Agency
No license is granted to World IP beyond permitted nominative use. These Terms do not create a partnership, joint venture, franchise, or agency relationship.
16) Governing Law; Venue; Dispute Resolution
Governing Law: Cayman Islands. Dispute Resolution: Binding arbitration consistent with the structure used in World User Terms v4.0, subject to commercial-party adaptations as designated by WF.
17) Notices; Entire Agreement; Survival
·       Notices: Via email to Affiliate’s onboarding address or through the Affiliate dashboard.
·       Entire Agreement: These Terms (and incorporated policies) constitute the entire agreement governing the Program.
·       Survival: Fraud, clawback, taxes, IP, dispute resolution, and restricted territories provisions survive termination.
Appendix A — Compliance & Operations Recommendations
·       Holdback Window: 14–30 days; extendable on risk flags.
·       Attribution Telemetry: Deterministic first-bound code; prevent code stacking in-app.
·       Fraud Heuristics: Device fingerprint mismatches, SIM clusters, velocity limits, geo-evasion indicators, identical wallet reuse.
·       Rate Management: Publish a canonical Program Rate Card page and maintain a change log with effective dates.
·       Brand Guardrails: Default to nominative text; pre-approval flow for logos and paid ads; periodic audits.
Appendix B — Open Questions for Product & Legal
·       Attribution Model: Confirm first-touch (first-bound code) vs. last-touch preference.
·       Holdback & Clawback: Confirm 14, 21, or 30 days and events that extend the window.
·       Caps: Per-Affiliate monthly caps (count or USD) and a global monthly budget guardrail.
·       Geo Map: Beyond New York and Brazil, identify pilot-included and excluded countries.
·       Ad Channels: Permit paid search/social? Any pre-approval or copy repository requirements?
·       Sub-Affiliates: Allowed or prohibited? If allowed, define disclosure, flow-down obligations, and audit rights.
·       Reference Rate: Specify the source and window for USD→WLD conversion at withdrawal (e.g., 1-hour VWAP, daily fix, or oracle).
·       Dispute Resolution Seat: Mirror World §13–14 or designate a bespoke commercial seat and rules?
