/**
 * __useDeleteTeamMemberMutation__
 *
 * To run a mutation, you first call `useDeleteTeamMemberMutation` within a React component and pass it any options that fit your needs.
 * When your component renders, `useDeleteTeamMemberMutation` returns a tuple that includes:
 * - A mutate function that you can call at any time to execute the mutation
 * - An object with fields that represent the current status of the mutation's execution
 *
 * @param baseOptions options that will be passed into the mutation, supported options are listed on: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react-hooks/#options-2;
 *
 * @example
 * const [deleteTeamMemberMutation, { data, loading, error }] = useDeleteTeamMemberMutation({
 *   variables: {
 *      id: // value for 'id'
 *   },
 * });
