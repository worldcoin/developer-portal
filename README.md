# Developer Portal

The Worldcoin Developer Portal provides tools to interact with the [World ID Protocol](https://worldcoin.org/world-id). Along with [IDKit](https://github.com/worldcoin/idkit-js), it's the fastest way to get started with proof of personhood üöÄ

World ID is the privacy-first identity protocol that brings global proof of personhood to the internet. More on World ID in the [announcement blog post](https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/introducing-world-id-and-sdk).

World ID lets you seamlessly integrate authentication into your app that verifies accounts belong to real persons through [Sign in with Worldcoin](https://docs.worldcoin.org/id/sign-in). For additional flexibility and cases where you need extreme privacy, [Anonymous Actions](https://docs.worldcoin.org/id/anonymous-actions) lets you verify users in a way that cannot be tracked across verifications.

Follow the [Quick Start](https://docs.worldcoin.org/quick-start) guide for the easiest way to get started.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Developing Locally

The Developer Portal uses some external services to operate. You do **not** need all credentials to be set for the Dev Portal to work. The credentials you need depends on which services you are running locally. Here are the list of external credentials you will need.

- [Alchemy API](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/api-overview)
- [Worldcoin Signup Sequencer](https://github.com/worldcoin/signup-sequencer)
- [AWS Key Management Service](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/)

### KMS Setup

To start using the JWKS features of the portal, some prior setup in your AWS account is required. Specifically, an IAM role needs to be provisioned with the following policies attached:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "kms:GetPublicKey",
        "kms:TagResource",
        "kms:ScheduleKeyDeletion",
        "kms:PutKeyPolicy",
        "kms:DescribeKey",
        "kms:Verify",
        "kms:Sign"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:*:<ACCOUNT_NUMBER>:key/*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "VisualEditor1",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "kms:CreateKey",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Dev Login

To make it easy to debug

### Starting the app

The following command will start two containers with the Postgres database, and Hasura server. Additionally, it will run the Next.js app from the [/web](./web) directory. All Hasura migrations and metadata are automatically applied.

```bash
docker compose up --detach
cd web && pnpm dev
```

### Updating Database Model

If you need to update anything related to the database (model, permissions, events, etc.) the easiest way is with the Hasura console.

1. Follow instructions to install the [Hasura CLI](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/hasura-cli/install-hasura-cli/).
2. Launch the Hasura console.
   ```bash
   cd hasura
   hasura console --endpoint http://localhost:8080 --admin-secret secret!
   ```

> **Warning** Make sure to only make the changes in the Hasura console (usually `http://localhost:9665`), if you make changes on `http://localhost:8080`the migrations will not be generated and your changes will be lost.

> üí° The admin secret in stored in `docker-compose.yml` file in the root of the repo.
